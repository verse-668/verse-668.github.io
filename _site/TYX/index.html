    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Tee walks.
      
        The footsteps ring loudly across the leaves, as Tee drags Yex, who is fast asleep, through the dark forest where the two find themselves.
      
        A gentle mist fills the air, and the first rays of the morning sun peek through the trees, which loom large overhead.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        The two come to a stop, as Tee observes a rough trench, the ghost of a river that once ran strong, perhaps, its crevices filled with rocks and sticks and moss.
      
        Above the trench there is an old bridge, its tattered beams and rusted bolts still holding firm.
      
        Tee crosses the bridge, cautiously, and looks back at Yex, who is still peacefully asleep.
      
        Tee smiles, briefly, perhaps finding comfort in the fact that somebody else had been here before, even if it was long ago.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Tee’s gaze drifts back to the forest ahead.
      
        But in the next instant, a beast emerges from the woods, its shiny black fur glinting in the early morning sun.
      
        Frozen with fear, Tee has no choice but to gaze into the eyes of the beast, who stares back, its green eyes full of life, but full of hunger.
      
        There is a moment of silence, but the beast quickly vanishes into the mystery of the forest, by some stroke of luck, driven away by a sudden stampede of small creatures that scatter into the area.
      
        Tee stands for a moment, dazed, as it all happened so fast, and turns around one more time to look at Yex, before continuing to move forward.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        “Where are we?”
      
        Yex speaks, as the two stand in an elevated clearing.
      
        A vast and mountainous landscape is visible, and the sun shines brightly above their heads, but the air is brisk and the day is windy.
      
        After a short moment, Tee speaks.
      
        “We’ll rest here.
      
        It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”
      
        Yex stares at the open terrain ahead, and responds.
      
        “I’m cold.”
      
        Tee does not respond, taking a moment to sit down, and there is silence between the two.
      
        Eventually, Yex speaks again.
      
        “I’m cold.
      
        Also, I don’t understand where we are.
      
        How is it possible?
      
        I could have sworn, we were just.”
      
        Yex trails off, as the wind picks up and roars through the trees, causing a few leaves to flutter to the ground, while others are sent flying over the cliffs and into the valley below.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Tee does not say anything for some time, and is instead focused on assembling sticks and leaves from the ground into a small pile.
      
        Yex appears intrigued, observing carefully.
      
        Finally, Tee speaks.
      
        “It’s not so important where we are.
      
        It matters more that we can rest here.
      
        Even if it’s only for a little while.
      
        I will make you a fire, and it will keep you warm.”
      
        Yex continues to watch, and appears confused, almost, and speaks.
      
        “But where did you learn to make a fire?”
      
        Tee pauses, looking at Yex, and responds.
      
        “It’s really not too difficult.
      
        But that’s a good question.
      
        I don’t quite remember, if I’m being honest.
      
        I must have learned a long time ago.”
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        A dark cloud passes in front of the sun, casting shade on the two, and Yex speaks, shivering.
      
        “Can you teach me?”
      
        “Of course.
      
        I already am, as you have watched me, all this time.
      
        But observe carefully, now, because this is the hardest part.”
      
        Tee is now attempting to create a spark, as Yex watches.
      
        And after some time, and many attempts, a glowing spark makes contact with a fragile leaf in the pile.
      
        And suddenly, the fire bursts into life, its flames flickering and dancing in the wind.
      
        Yex flinches slightly, perhaps taken aback by the suddenness of the flames, but Tee smiles, and speaks.
      
        “Here.
      
        This will keep you warm.”
      
        The two huddle around the fire.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        “I just don’t get it.”
      
        Yex speaks, walking in front of Tee.
      
        The terrain is rocky and barren, and the sun shines relentlessly overhead, as the two move across the uneven ground, the heat almost visible in the air.
      
        Yex continues to speak.
      
        “I’m bored.
      
        And my feet hurt.”
      
        Yex looks down, observing small drops of blood that are left behind as the two walk.
      
        Tee responds.
      
        “I know it’s not pleasant, but boredom is good for you.
      
        Don’t complain, be grateful.”
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Yex suddenly stops walking, and turns around to face Tee.
      
        “Why?
      
        Why should I be grateful?
      
        Don’t you see that I’m in pain?”
      
        Yex falls to the ground, sighing.
      
        Tee is silent for some time, and moves towards Yex until the two are side by side.
      
        “There are plenty of things to be grateful for.
      
        Your shoes, for example.
      
        They’re old, I know, but that’s better than walking without them, right?
      
        And we could lie here all day and complain, but that doesn’t sound fun to me, either.”
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Salty tears begin to form around Yex’s eyes, who still lies on the ground, but they dry quickly in the heat.
      
        “But you don’t get it.
      
        What if I don’t want to walk anymore?
      
        Where are we going anyway?
      
        And why is it so hot out here?”
      
        Drops of sweat fall from Tee’s forehead, who speaks.
      
        “I know that it’s brutal out here, so if you don’t want to walk, then run, run like the wind, and don’t look back, and I will follow close behind, but we can’t rest here, I’m sorry.”
      
        Yex does not respond, but stands up, slowly.
      
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        “I’m hungry.”
      
        Yex speaks, walking beside Tee.
      
        The terrain is flat and full of life, but the evening air is cool, and huge trees cast long shadows onto the mossy forest floor.
      
        Tee responds, looking ahead.
      
        “We’ll eat soon.
      
        I’m hungry, too.”
      
        Yex does not respond, and only mimics Tee’s quick footsteps, moving swiftly through the forest.
      
        As the sunlight fades and darkness sweeps over them, fireflies fill the air, thousands, it seems, flashing hypnotically, and the two listen, for they can hear things in the woods, the snarling and rustling of creatures and beasts.
      
        Yex looks around, anxiously, perhaps concerned by the sounds of the forest, but Tee stays focused on the path ahead.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        The silence between the two is long, possibly the longest they’ve ever had.
      
        Finally, Yex speaks.
      
        “If we keep moving, and we always find something to eat, will we live forever?”
      
        Tee responds after a few moments.
      
        “I’m not sure, but yes, I think so, although it will not be easy.
      
        Because we are only here today, and I know we are fragile, so we can die, I’m certain of that.
      
        But if we fight and work and sweat, day after day, then we can live not just today but tomorrow, too, so we can live forever.”
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Again, there is a long silence, and Yex appears to be lost in thought, but keeps up with Tee’s hurried pace.
      
        Yex speaks.
      
        “If you were granted one wish, what would it be?
      
        I don’t know if I would wish to live forever.”
      
        Tee responds, but does not slow down.
      
        “That’s a good question.
      
        I’ve thought about it before, actually.
      
        I think I’d wish to know who was here before us.
      
        I know there was someone, I’m sure of it.
      
        But you and me, are we special?
      
        It’s hard to know, for time keeps secrets, it seems.
      
        At the very least, I hope they were able to enjoy the grace of the forest.”
      
        Yex listens, but yet again, there is silence, and the two continue to walk.
      
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        “Thanks for walking with me.”
      
        Yex speaks, as the two walk along an open shore, a vast blue sea extending into the horizon.
      
        The sun has set, but its glow is still visible, and the light of the stars begins to pierce the night sky.
      
        But despite the nightfall, the air is warm.
      
        There is some distance between the two, but they walk in stride.
      
        Yex moves through the sand, but Tee walks closer to the sea, occasionally stepping in the waves that crash onto the shore.
      
        Tee speaks.
      
        “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”
      
        Yex slows down, and takes a moment to gaze at the water, before responding.
      
        “It’s truly beautiful, indeed.”
      
        Tee smiles, and slows down, too, the soft sound of footsteps lost against the roar of the waves.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Yex speaks after a moment.
      
        “I don’t know where I would be without you.
      
        You have given me so much.
      
        You taught me how to make a fire, so very long ago.
      
        You taught me to be grateful, to accept the things that I can’t change, and to change the things I can.
      
        Thank you.”
      
        Tee stops walking, and looks at Yex.
      
        “No, I should thank you.
      
        For I know that you learned these things from me, and they are important in life, yes.
      
        But you have given me something far greater.
      
        You have given me a friend.”
      
        Yex has stopped walking, by now, and they stand together, holding each other in a gentle embrace.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Eventually, Tee speaks again.
      
        “But I worry about you, because I think I was wrong.
      
        I think that we do not live forever, for although life is great, I fear death is greater.”
      
        Yex responds.
      
        “You don’t need me, in fact, I need you, because even if I won’t be here, you will.
      
        And they will be here, too, and you will tell them about me, day after day, year after year.
      
        You will tell them about my glory and my mistakes and everything in between.
      
        And they will laugh and cry and scream, and tell you that you’re right and tell you that you’re wrong, but you will not stop, you will continue to tell them my story.
      
        And eventually there will be a day when they beg and beg and beg you to leave, yet their clothes are sewn with my name, and that’s when you can finally rest.”
      
    </p>
    
  

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        The terrain is hilly, and barren, except for a few shrubs scattered across the ground.
      
        The night sky is out in all its glory, the bright stars and the full moon illuminating the landscape.
      
        Yex walks slowly, behind Tee.
      
        The two do not speak, but they hear the roar of a river.
      
        Eventually, the two arrive upon its bank, and Tee finally speaks.
      
        “Here, let’s rest.”
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        “I think I get it now, my friend.
      
        To ask why is to worry about causes and reasons.
      
        But just as there is death in this life, there is life in death, too.
      
        This instant does not create the next, but rather, the moments flow and splash in time, like this river, powerful, indeed, but forever fleeting.
      
        And I can’t see where the water comes from or where the water goes in the end, but I am here, now, and I can feel its current across my fingers, cold and fast.”
      
        Tee smiles, but does not respond to Yex’s words.
      
        Yex takes a small drink from the river and continues to speak.
      
        “And we are here simply because we are.
      
        It is easy to wonder why, but not everything needs a cause, I don’t think.
      
        This is the truth that I was searching for, and I was staring it in its eyes all along.”
      
        Tee, too, takes a drink from the river, and responds.
      
        “You are far smarter than me, my friend, smarter than I can ever be.
      
        And for that, I am proud of you.”
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Yex remains entranced with the river, and eventually speaks after some time.
      
        “But although we are strong, we must remember that time keeps secrets, too.
      
        For one day this river might carve a canyon and dry up, leaving its legacy on these hills.
      
        And someday, somebody might come across the canyon, and they will appreciate its elegance.
      
        And if they try hard enough, they can maybe even see the river that once ran strong, cutting through the rocks.
      
        But they will never feel its current across their fingers.”
      
        There is silence as the two sit.
      
        “I enjoy hearing you speak, my friend.
      
        And yes, I agree, I think I’d want to know how, rather than why.
      
        But will they be like us, whoever comes across the canyon?
      
        Will they be like you and me?”
      
        Yex looks at Tee, and appears almost confused, but again there is silence.
      
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Rain falls from the sky as Tee walks, the sound drowning out the labored footsteps.
      
        The night is coming to an end, but heavy clouds keep the sky dark.
      
        Tee drags Yex, almost in the same way that the two traveled long ago, when Yex was healthy and sleeping.
      
        Now, Yex is sick and can hardly move.
      
        A flash of lightning illuminates the sky, briefly, revealing the vast and mountainous terrain.
      
        Tears begin to form around Tee’s eyes, perhaps out of fear of losing Yex.
      
        Thunder roars, and Yex mumbles something, but the words are unintelligible.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Suddenly, in a brief moment, Tee trips on a small stick, and falls, sending the two tumbling down the face of the mountain.
      
        But they slide to a stop, by some stroke of luck, despite the slippery leaves and mud.
      
        Tee sits for a moment, dazed, as it all happened so fast.
      
        Tee holds Yex tight, and looks up at the clouds above, before eventually standing back up, cautiously.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Tee looks to the right, at the trees that stand strong on the slope.
      
        Then to the left, at the great valley below, beautiful, and full of life, but scary, for Tee knows that the two could never climb out if they ever found themselves there.
      
        Then in front, longingly, almost as if the city lights were visible, but only the terrain lies ahead, dark and static and wet.
      
        The tears stream down Tee’s face, but they are lost in the rain, which pours, strong and steady.
      
        Finally, Tee looks behind, taking one more moment to appreciate Yex’s gentle face, before continuing to move forward.
