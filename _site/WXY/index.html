        “Oh, I wouldn’t say that.
      
        I never really choose the things I believe.
      
        But I choose to be religious because I know that I must have faith, when I have nothing else.”

        “So god isn’t real?
      
        None of that stuff is true?”
      
        “It’s not always about what’s true, or false.
      
        It’s not that religion is true, or false, but it is powerful, my child, far more powerful than you could know.”
      
        “But why, then, should there even be anything at all, instead of nothing?”
      
        “I don’t know.
      
        You can always ask why, my child, and to ask why is to be human, but matters of truths and causes are not so clear to me.
      
        Truths are true because they are, and I know that I am here today, the universe telling me its one truth.
      
        There is something because there is.
      
        As for nothing, well, nothing is here, too, right beside us.
      
        But today, there is something, and for that, I am grateful.”
      
        “That doesn’t make sense.
      
        So you will only ever know truth from your perspective?
      
        Some things are true for everyone, like it’s true that the grass is green and the sky is blue and the clouds are made of water, right?”
      
        “Oh, I sure hope so, but it’s hard to know everything.
      
        The universe doesn’t owe it to you to make sense.
      
        Truth is a difficult thing, my child.
      
        And yes, I’m sure there are many truths of the universe, but I can only wonder how magnificent they might be.
      
        And I hope that I can know them someday, as I’m sure you do too, but we are only human.
      
        But please, my child, remember that truth is not always good, or bad, it’s just there.
      
        So you must do your best with what you are given.”

        You are a beautiful creation, more complex and intricate than you could know.
      
        But as far as truth goes, you are only given one.
      
        You know it in your heart and in your soul, just as I know it, because it is true.
      
        And it is certainly not an easy truth, because like you said, you can only ever know it from your perspective.
      
        But as long as you are here, my child, the universe will be here, too, showing its face, so hold your truth close, because it is all that you will ever have.”

        Matters of good and bad are not very clear to me.”
      
        “But some things are bad, right?
      
        What about killing or stealing or all of the other evil things?”
      
        “Yes, some things are bad, I’m sure.
      
        But I don’t need religion to tell me what’s good and bad.
      
        It is part of me, I know it and feel it in my soul, and I doubt that religion could change my mind anyway.”

        “Oh, it’s not easy at all, my child.
      
        But good and bad are not facts, they are judgments, comparisons, almost, but not facts, so be careful.”
      
        “So good and bad are different for everyone?”
      
        “Yes, I suppose, because what’s good for the light must be bad for the darkness.
      
        But don’t worry, just be careful, my child, because we are not perfect, me and you, as physical beings, so you may go your whole life without ever truly understanding the nature of good and bad.

        To fight for what is good?
      
        Because sometimes, dad, I struggle with meaning, and despite the joys of life, everything feels pointless, and I’ve begun to doubt that I have a purpose at all.”
      
        “Oh, you have a purpose.
      
        It might be less obvious than the purpose of a pencil or a broom, but if you look hard enough, I’m sure you’ll find it.
      
        I know it’s hard, but don’t worry, my child, because life is precious, not because you have purpose, but because you are human.
      
        And I agree, to do good is a beautiful pursuit, but there is more in life than just good or bad things.
      
        Purpose is a challenge, unattainable, in a way, because although you are alive, you are much, much more.
      
        But that’s the beauty of it.
      
        Because we are in this universe, but so too is the universe in us.
      
        Do not look to the stars to give you meaning, for it is you, my child, who gives meaning to the stars.”

        Sometimes when nothing feels right, all you can do is look out at the universe, and ask for mercy.
      
        I know it’s hard, and it’s not fair, not at all, I’m sorry.
      
        And you can suppress it and run from it and hide from it all you want.

        But those moments are gone, and you can only move forward.
      
        It is easy to worry about what could or would or should have been, and such things are human, but they are not real, no, not quite as real as the birds or the trees.
      
        There are only decisions, and there are consequences.
      
        But don’t be too hard on yourself either, because you can only learn from your world, and your world can only be a result of all that you’ve done.
      
        And it might get worse, but it will get better, I promise.
      
        I won’t tell you how to live your life, because your life is yours alone, but please be kind, because pain can be contagious.
      
        But you will be kind, I’m sure of it, my child, because just as I have faith in the universe, I have faith in you, too, and that’s why I brought you into this world.”

        Many die there, and others are born there, but most wander there aimlessly, seeking refuge, or out of curiosity, or by accident, and they get stuck, like I did, long before you were here.
      
        It might be hard for you to understand, my child, but hell can be comfortable, you see.
      
        And there is only one way out, straight through, through the flames and the agony and the darkness.
      
        So if you find yourself there, do not have shame, stand proud, for you are strong.

        Such questions are interesting, but they are hardly matters of truth, I’ve found.
      
        We are physical creatures, me and you.
      
        So we are at the mercy of the physical laws of the universe.

        I know it’s hard, but to me, the truth of the universe is enough, and the universe tells me that I am free.

        Matters of good and bad are not easy, and they never will be, and it’s tragic, indeed.
      
        But it’s a blessing, too, because if good and bad were simple, I doubt we would be here at all, for it is only within the subtleties of good and bad where I have ever found duty.

        And excuses may be a reason, but they are not enough, not in the way that I see it.
      
        Because even if you wish to do good, intent is not quite enough, either.
      
        Bad intentions are rare, I’ve found.

        We are physical beings, me and you, and we are small, no match for the roaring furnace of the universe.
      
        But that’s the beauty of it, in a way.
      
        Because you can always push yourself to be better, always, my child, for there are no limits to faith.
      
        That is what makes us human.
      
        But please, don’t be too hard on yourself, my child, just be kind and be honest, and most importantly, never let go of your faith.
      
        Fighting to do good is not a matter of right and wrong, or true and false.

        But you can only receive in love what you give, because love goes both ways, always, for love is a connection, between life and death, or between your soul and the stars.”

        “But sometimes I feel that love hides from me.
      
        It’s like I can hear it around the corner, and I swear I have even caught up to it and caught a glimpse of its ghost, but I have never truly grasped it.”
      
        “I know it can be hard, my child, believe me.
      
        The wonders of this universe are undeniably magnificent, but they are too vast.
      
        But that’s the beauty of it, in a way, because love does not end.”
      
        “But how should I even begin to understand it, dad?”
      
        “I wish I could give you an easy answer, my child, I really do, but I fear that love is greater than what could ever be described.
      
        I know the universe can be cold, and death is relentless.
      
        But just as love is a feeling, it is an action.
      
        And even though love can be tragic and desperate and fleeting, there is nothing greater than love, because love is why we are here, me and you.
      
        So please, my child, do everything in love.”

        “But I feel lonely sometimes, dad.
      
        And I’m grateful to have you, I really am, but what about after you’re gone?”
      
        “It’s okay, my child.
      
        I know that love is not easy, and love is not fair, either.
      
        But you are strong, stronger than you could ever imagine.
      
        There is pain and struggle and suffering in this world, I know.
      
        There will always be pain and struggle, so much of it, and I’m sorry.
      
        But don’t worry, my child, because I love you.
      
        And it is not just me saying this, the universe is talking to you, my child, because you must remember, although we are in this universe, so too is the universe in us.
      
        And the universe said I love you, too.
      
        And please, my child, do not forget that, even after I’m long gone.”
