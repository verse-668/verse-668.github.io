    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        The traveler lies awake.
      
        She knows that she should get some sleep before the journey that lies ahead, but she is restless.
      
        And although the traveler knows that she has had a good life, born and raised on earth, she was never quite satisfied with the whims of the world.
      
        So she built an impressive machine, a vessel, capable of taking a single passenger on an epic journey through space and time.
      
        And as the traveler lies awake, her thoughts race, thinking about what lies ahead, mostly, wondering what awaits her, if humanity will have even made it all the way out there.

      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Eventually, the moment arrives, and the traveler faces the vessel.
      
        She knows that she will have to leave her home behind, because although the vessel is impressive, and it is fast, it can only move forward.
      
        The emotions flow through her, anxiety, excitement, fear, but they all seem to blend together as she takes one last glance at earth.
      
        And the traveler sees her fellow humans, surrounding her, clapping and cheering and crying, but their faces all look the same to her.
      
        But she is at ease, because she feels as though she has seen all that this world could offer, and will be satisfied with her journey, no matter if she is enlightened or destroyed.
      
        The traveler steps into the vessel, and its door shuts.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And as the computers and engines of the vessel whir to life, the traveler notices a small note, left by someone she knows, a dear friend, perhaps.
      
        Good luck, it reads, and the traveler smiles and almost drops the note, but decides to turn it over, revealing scribbled text, scratched out, but still legible.
      
        The traveler examines the paper for a few moments, confused, before speaking the written words out loud, not to anybody in particular.
      
        “Do you believe in obligation?”

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        The traveler observes a new world, gleaming bright against the blackness of the void behind it.
      
        From her perspective, she has only just left earth, but she knows that by now, she must already be a million eons away.
      
        She is nervous, but mostly relieved, because she knows that there was no guarantee that the vessel would find humans, all the way out here.
      
        But as the vessel lands atop an impressive structure and the traveler steps out, all thoughts of home vanish.
      
        She gazes out at the view, golden skyscrapers and glimmering bridges extending past the horizon, as far as her eyes can see.
      
        “Welcome, traveler.
      
        I know who you are.
      
        There were rumors that someone like you could be out there.
      
        I represent humanity, on this world, in all our glory.
      
        I am beyond honored that you chose to visit our world.”
      
        The traveler is startled by the voice, loud and clear, and she turns around, and she sees the representative, undeniably human, quite like herself, in a way.
      
        “It’s gorgeous, but, I.”
      
        The traveler does not quite finish her sentence, as she looks at the representative, who smiles, genuinely, and looks back.
      
        “Do not worry, dear traveler, I know you must have had quite a journey.
      
        I will show you what we have built.
      
        The limits of humanity are greater than you could possibly dream.”

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        “Do you not see it?
      
        Your world, it’s absolutely stunning, dear representative, and I can’t say I’ve ever seen anything like it back home.
      
        Let me ask, how did you achieve such perfection?”
      
        “It took a lot of work.
      
        A lot, dear traveler, and I don’t think you would really understand what we’ve been through on this world.
      
        But it was worth the toil, because now, we have it all.
      
        Any problem you can think of has been solved and any pleasure you can imagine is free.”
      
        “But, dear representative, what’s the secret?
      
        Have you found it?
      
        Something divine, magical, even, something true and pure in all of the chaos?”
      
        And the representative laughs, but looks away, and does not respond.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        By now, the traveler sits, and she is enjoying this world, but she feels a profound emptiness, too.
      
        “I am not surprised that you are curious, dear traveler, and maybe you can understand me, because I know that you are from earth.
      
        Oh, if only I could have seen earth, the moon and the pyramids.
      
        Because sometimes I stand where you are now, and I look out into the universe, at all the beauty that I can see.
      
        But it feels so empty, because I know I still have not seen all of it, and I worry that I have barely even scratched the surface.
      
        But still, I am happy, or at least I hope.
      
        And you are more than welcome to stay, dear traveler, if you’d like, and maybe you can help me understand what it is all about.”
      
        And the traveler had suspected that the representative would eventually ask, but still, the words stun her, because although she is grateful to have seen this world, she knows in her heart and soul that she cannot stay.
      
        “I would love to, dear representative.
      
        But will you keep me strong?
      
        For I fear that I am not yet sure what I am searching for.
      
        And I’m grateful for you, I really am, I promise, but can you inspire me?”

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        The traveler finds herself lost.
      
        Her memory is fuzzy since exiting the vessel, and she stands atop some sort of overpass, looking down at the humans of this world, who fly past, so fast, it seems.
      
        A cold snow falls from the sky, but not quite like the snow on earth, and the traveler cannot help but think of home.
      
        “Be careful, traveler.”
      
        The representative stands behind the traveler, but she does not turn, and only gazes at the concrete halls below.
      
        “Where am I?”
      
        And although she is confident, as she has prepared well for her journey, she is anxious, too, because she worries about time.
      
        “I know, the walls are thick and the wind is harsh sometimes.
      
        But at least I’m here with you, right?”
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        “I should give you something, dear representative.
      
        I don’t quite know what it is, yet, but you deserve it, all of you, the humans of this world.
      
        And it’s not anything perfect, but it’s something, and even just by speaking to you, now, I am creating it, putting it out into the world.”
      
        The representative is silent for a moment.
      
        “You are free to do as you wish here, traveler.
      
        But please, promise me that as you wander these walls, you will be careful, and more importantly, you will be precise, because the stairs are many, but the doors are locked, you see.”
      
        The traveler finally turns around and looks into the eyes of the representative.
      
        “But I need my ship.
      
        Where is it?
      
        Tell me, please, dear representative, because I really should get going by now.”
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        The traveler is frustrated, for she does not understand this world, as she wanders its streets and steps, searching.
      
        But even in the maze, the representative always seems to follow her close.
      
        “I can help you, traveler.
      
        I do not know where your ship is.
      
        But let me ask, is it hiding from you, or are you hiding from it?”
      
        The traveler does not listen, and sits in a dark corner of an empty corridor.
      
        And her eye catches something peculiar, fluttering softly in the wind, a page of an old book, perhaps.
      
        She examines it, for a moment, but she cannot understand its mysterious symbols.
      
        And the traveler wishes she could read it, for she knows that it must have meaning, but she can only wonder.
      
        And she feels contempt towards the representative, in this moment, and she almost wants to cry and scream, but she stops herself.
      
        “I will accept your help, dear representative, and I am grateful, but I hope you know that although this world is impressive, you can do better, I’m sure of it.”

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        The traveler sits comfortably in the vessel, gazing out of its window.
      
        This world is empty and dark, it seems, but peaceful, the stars above dimly lighting up the rivers and fields around her.
      
        And as she sits, her thoughts race, thinking about home and herself and all the worlds she has seen.
      
        She almost wishes she could stay in the vessel forever, only watching tomorrow instead of living it.
      
        But she knows she has no choice, for she is a traveler, so she begins to roam this world.
      
        And humanity’s presence is subtle, but certain, as she wanders aimlessly through the crops and the ruins.
      
        The traveler cannot quite grasp what it is, but this world gives her an eerie feeling, enough to send a shiver down her spine.
      
        “Who are you?”
      
        She knew to expect the representative, eventually, but not like this.
      
        “I am a traveler.
      
        I come from a world, far, far away.”
      
        The representative does not move, and only stares at the traveler.
      
        “I guess it was only a matter of time before someone like you showed up.”
      
        The traveler is confused.
      
        “How is life on your world?
      
        Are you happy?
      
        Tell me, please, because I know that you are human, and you represent the humans of this world.”

        The representative and the traveler face each other.
      
        It is night, and it is dark.
      
        “Do you understand it now?”
      
        “Maybe.
      
        I don’t know.
      
        Because what if you’re wrong?”
      
        “If I’m wrong then I’m wrong, and I fear it every day.
      
        But I’d rather be wrong and be destroyed than live without trying.”
      
        “You don’t get it.
      
        You’ll never know what it’s like to be me.”
      
        “I know, I never will.
      
        But do you not dream of grandeur?
      
        Do you not wonder what lies between you and the face of death?”
      
        And as the traveler and the representative face each other, the sky lights up, epic purples and pinks flooding the heavens, almost as if there were a window into the soul of infinity ^^TKS^^.

        By now, the traveler is inside, and she is cozy, but she is lost in her thoughts.
      
        The representative speaks, offering the traveler a warm drink.
      
        “Would you like some?”
      
        The traveler glances up.
      
        “Yes, please, thank you.”
      
        “But what is your secret, traveler?
      
        How do you find the strength to continue your journey, when even the stars themselves begin to cool down?”
      
        The traveler smiles, but looks down.
      
        “I don’t know.
      
        I’ll be completely honest with you, dear representative.
      
        I don’t believe in ghosts.
      
        But still, I fear there is more in life and death than what is possible in this world.
      
        But it doesn’t keep me up at night, no, not quite like it used to.
      
        It only inspires me to climb closer to glory.
      
        And I don’t know if my pride or my heart will destroy me first, but I don’t think that I could stop fighting, even if I wanted, because I fear what I am more than anything.”
      
        The representative’s eyes are closed, and there is a moment of silence.
      
        “Your words impress me.”

        The traveler stands in a peaceful garden, high in the sky, and does not speak to anybody in particular, gazing at the white arches and elegant columns around her.
      
        She is at ease, but exhausted, certainly, for the journey has been long.
      
        She notices the vines, especially, climbing up the walls, gracefully yet relentlessly.
      
        “It catches up to you, doesn’t it?”
      
        The voice comes from behind the traveler, out of sight.

        But we have overcome our struggles, dear traveler, and built a paradise among the stars.”
      
        The traveler and the representative sit, together, overlooking the world, their legs swinging freely in the open air.
      
        “Dear representative, you impress me.
      
        For I have seen many worlds on my journey, gold and grim, barren and nonsensical, and everything in between.
      
        But there is always more to see, as every world is something new, something unique, but it can be lonely, too.
      
        And I enjoy my travels, I really do, but I love your world, with all my heart, and I would love to stay, to live and die here.
      
        But it would not be the end of my journey, no, but a new beginning, I’d hope.”
      
        The representative looks at the traveler, and she notices an expression of deep sadness in the representative, something she has not seen in a very long time.
      
        “I’m sorry, beloved traveler, but you can’t stay.”

        And as she looks at the unfamiliar stars, she is overcome with a deep nostalgia so profound that it is almost unbearable, the feeling of home so close, but she still cannot quite grasp it.
      
        “But why?
      
        I trust you, dear representative, and I promise that I can offer you more than you could know, so don’t you trust me, too?”
      
        But even as the words flow out, she is distracted, and she only thinks of her home and her bed.
      
        “I’m sorry, I really am, but it’s just the way it is.
      
        You are a traveler.
      
        This is not the place for you.”
      
        And the traveler is heartbroken, but she understands, because she knows that the representative is right, in a way, her humanity no match for that of this world.

        This world is gray, and stormy, with mighty cities extending past the horizon, reflective blacks and jagged towers as far as her eyes can see.
      
        And despite the fierce wind against her back, she finds comfort in the view.
      
        The traveler notices the representative, facing away from her, looking down, at the streets below.
      
        “Impressive.”

        I didn’t think you’d ever end up here.”
      
        She sees that the representative is a warrior, worn down from ages of conflict, but undeniably human, quite like herself.
      
        But the traveler’s age shows, too, in her eyes, especially, because although the vessel is remarkable, the journey has been long.

        And I’m speaking to you, dear humans of this world, because if you can see it, too, then your world can heal, and you will be greater than you could possibly dream.
      
        I don’t know what I did to deserve my journey and my vessel.
      
        But I know that I must help you, and if I die trying then I will die, being grateful to have been at your service.

        “Continue, please, traveler, I am listening.”

        The traveler finds herself launched into the air.
      
        An error in the vessel’s systems, perhaps, or some unfortunate collision, but the ship cannot handle it, using its dying effort to keep the traveler safe, as it crashes into the grass below in a fiery explosion.
      
        The traveler watches as flames consume the vessel, trillions of transistors breaking as the ship disintegrates, its infinite complexity vanishing, swallowed by the life of the fire, reduced to a hunk of metal and plastic and glass.
      
        And in this moment, the traveler almost cannot believe her eyes, as it all happened so fast.
      
        But she is at ease, because although now she can never leave, she already knew that, for home is millions of eons away, lost to time, which she knew would eventually claim her vessel, too.

        The traveler notices a tattered structure, overgrown and crumbling, that she recognizes as human from its rugged square angles and intricate pillars, too complex to be created by wind and water.
      
        And after looking closer, she sees faded words, an engraving at the top of the structure, and to her surprise, she even recognizes some of the chiseled symbols.
      
        And although the meaning is unintelligible, she smiles, because even here, so many eons away, she sees a reflection of home.
      
        Still descending slowly, she makes out the text, which reads T–v- K_–-d– S–-j.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And when the traveler touches the surface, she falls to her knees, bringing her face almost to the soft grass.
      
        And she speaks, out loud, the words ringing out into the open clearing in front.
      
        “Dear universe, in all your glory, let me speak to you, please.
      
        I don’t know where you brought me, but if I am alone, let me be at peace, and if they await me, let them await me with love.
      
        And I know I can never go back home, but I’m grateful I had it, and I am grateful for my journey, too, the beauty and the grace of it all.
      
        And although I have seen so much of you, I fear I have only caught a glimpse of your truth, for you are too grand, dear universe.
      
        So hold me close, my creator and my grave, as I ask you, dearly, to bring me fortune and to bring me health in this world.
      
        Because just as I am part of you, you are part of me, too, so above all else, keep me strong, and let me be humble in your vastness.”
