      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/TRL/7/2/"><sup>2</sup></a></span>An error in the vessel’s systems, perhaps, or some unfortunate collision, but the ship cannot handle it, using its dying effort to keep the traveler safe, as it crashes into the grass below in a fiery explosion.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/TRL/7/3/"><sup>3</sup></a></span>The traveler watches as flames consume the vessel, trillions of transistors breaking as the ship disintegrates, its infinite complexity vanishing, swallowed by the life of the fire, reduced to a hunk of metal and plastic and glass.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/TRL/7/4/"><sup>4</sup></a></span>And in this moment, the traveler almost cannot believe her eyes, as it all happened so fast.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/TRL/7/5/"><sup>5</sup></a></span>But she is at ease, because although now she can never leave, she already knew that, for home is millions of eons away, lost to time, which she knew would eventually claim her vessel, too.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/TRL/7/7/"><sup>7</sup></a></span>And after looking closer, she sees faded words, an engraving at the top of the structure, and to her surprise, she even recognizes some of the chiseled symbols.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/TRL/7/8/"><sup>8</sup></a></span>And although the meaning is unintelligible, she smiles, because even here, so many eons away, she sees a reflection of home.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/TRL/7/9/"><sup>9</sup></a></span>Still descending slowly, she makes out the text, which reads T–v- K_–-d– S–-j.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/TRL/7/11/"><sup>11</sup></a></span>And she speaks, out loud, the words ringing out into the open clearing in front.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/TRL/7/16/"><sup>16</sup></a></span>So hold me close, my creator and my grave, as I ask you, dearly, to bring me fortune and to bring me health in this world.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/TRL/7/17/"><sup>17</sup></a></span>Because just as I am part of you, you are part of me, too, so above all else, keep me strong, and let me be humble in your vastness.”
