      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/1/"><sup>1</sup></a></span>But there is good in life, and there is good in the human.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/2/"><sup>2</sup></a></span>Happiness, health, peace, it has many names, but it is not clear where this good comes from, or what it is, exactly.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/3/"><sup>3</sup></a></span>But it is there, and it is real, because the human can feel it, the wonders of joy and love and laughter.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/4/"><sup>4</sup></a></span>And through its wants and needs, the human pursues this good, seeking to achieve better states of being.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/5/"><sup>5</sup></a></span>But desire is a tricky thing, and it always will be, for the human can only ever have the moment, but today is never quite the same as tomorrow.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/6/"><sup>6</sup></a></span>And the desires of the human collide chaotically with each other, forming its next decision, but there can be confusion and stress, because these desires live inside the human, only ever fighting for themselves.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/7/"><sup>7</sup></a></span>But the human knows that although it can only exist in the moment, tomorrow will come, so it tries to balance the good of today with the good of tomorrow.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/8/"><sup>8</sup></a></span>And as you learn and study and plan for the future you can grow stronger in the face of time.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/9/"><sup>9</sup></a></span>But even this can only be a pursuit of the moment, the closure found by knowing that tomorrow will be pleasant when it arrives.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/10/"><sup>10</sup></a></span>And as you live in your world, the things you do and think and consume, the people you surround yourself with and the hobbies you enjoy, all become a part of you.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/11/"><sup>11</sup></a></span>So even if it is not easy, you must be wise in what you pursue, because tomorrow is inevitable, no matter how much you wish to stay attached to the moment.

      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/12/"><sup>12</sup></a></span>And the human is unbelievably complex, of course, so it is easy to feel that health and peace are complicated.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/13/"><sup>13</sup></a></span>But in some ways, the health of the soul is a single thing, and therefore it is quite simple, indeed.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/14/"><sup>14</sup></a></span>And it may never be attainable, in its purest form, for you are finite in this physical universe.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/15/"><sup>15</sup></a></span>But you are strong, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/16/"><sup>16</sup></a></span>Of course, you are a physical being, so there are limits in your world, but even if you have nothing, you can always have faith.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/17/"><sup>17</sup></a></span>So even though your state is not a choice, and your emotions and struggles are only part of this state, it does not matter.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/18/"><sup>18</sup></a></span>But there are no limits to faith, so through faith you can achieve all possible things.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/5/19/"><sup>19</sup></a></span>So happiness is a choice, in a way, because if you have anything in this universe, you have the strength to pursue it.
