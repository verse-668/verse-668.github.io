        The human is a physical being.
      
        Therefore the human is at the mercy of the physical laws of the universe.
      
        And the human is a part of the universe, small in its size, perhaps, but remarkable in its complexity.
      
        So although the human is made of physical parts, it is alive.
      
        Therefore, the human is able to maintain its remarkable state, despite the decay of time.
      
        But not only is the human alive, it is aware, with memories and emotions, dreams and fears.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And the human knows that it is alive, that it is aware, and that it is in the universe.
      
        But this truth can only ever be personal, no matter how universal it seems, because the human will always be constrained within its finite being.
      
        Therefore, this experience can only ever be an approximation of the true nature of the universe, because although the human is remarkable, it is finite, a single piece of structure in the void.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        To be alive is not a choice, it is a fact, purely and undeniably true, given by the universe and understood by the human.
      
        But there can never be true certainty beyond the fact that the current moment exists, because the human is a physical being, a part of the physical universe.
      
        And this moment can be chaotic, full of vibrant colors and vivid thoughts, but it is not meaningless, for you have something far more powerful than truth.
      
        You have faith.
      
        Faith that tomorrow will come, and you will be here tomorrow, just as you are here today.
      
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Like all life, the human is tasked with navigating the physical universe from each moment to the next.
      
        And the human is remarkable, indeed, using its eyes and ears and thoughts to try to understand the universe where it lives.
      
        And these things work hard to combine to create the rich and vast experience of consciousness.
      
        So even though the human can only ever exist in the current moment, it lives gracefully, not just aware, but intelligent and curious, too.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Belief, knowledge, intuition, memories, emotions, it has many names, but the human uses it to understand itself and to navigate its world.
      
        Like all truth, these things can only ever be personal, a part of the human, arising from the physical cells and neurons and feelings that make up the human.
      
        But they can change in time, as you discover new experiences and conquer more and more of what is possible in your world.
      
        Memories of yesterday, too, can only ever be part of your state, and dreams of tomorrow are only prayers.
      
        But these things can’t be a choice, because they simply are.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        So belief is not a choice, it is like your hands, useful indeed, but not a choice, only there, a small part of your truth.
      
        For example, it is not that you ever choose to be convinced of an argument, or choose to see that the sky is blue, it simply happens, for one reason or another.
      
        And what you call knowledge might be more certain than what you call opinion or feeling, but these names are just approximations of various parts of your being.
      
        And sometimes knowledge is so innate and obvious that it is indistinguishable from universal truth, like the fact that you need water or that you would rather be happy than sad.
      
        But even still, these things are not truly certain, as the only truth is that of the moment.
      
        But that is not to say that choice doesn’t exist in this universe, because there is faith, and there is change.
      
        For if you hold yourself back, then you are bound, both by doubt and by the universe.
      
        But if you hold faith, then you are free, only bound by what is possible in this physical universe.
      
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        There is no difference between motion and change, for without one there could never be the other.
      
        And although time itself does not change, the universe changes in time.
      
        Therefore, the human changes, too, but more importantly, the human is free, able to move and think in its world.
      
        And to move is the most fundamental freedom, in a way, the ability to change against the rest of the universe.
      
        However, it is unreasonable to say that all movement is the choice of the human.
      
        And you can try to name parts of yourself, the conscious and subconscious, the mind and body and soul, but the boundary of decision is not quite a wall, it is more like a misty shore.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        For example, you hardly choose to remain asleep from each moment to the next, and same with breathing or blinking or balancing on two legs.
      
        These are not decisions, exactly, but they are actions, and their consequences ripple into the universe like stones thrown into the sea.
      
        Thoughts, too, are the movements of the mind, dancing atop the stage of your knowledge and beliefs, within your control, but only partially.
      
        But even still, you do have freedom, and if you choose to clap your hands, for example, you move because of your muscles, but also because of your will.
      
        So your action is a manifestation of your truth, your will and decisions colliding with the universe, like a chaotic game of strategy where your faith is your next move.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And there are limits in the physical universe, of course, and it is easy sometimes to get caught up in what you are or what you have, the things that you can or can’t do.
      
        But the possibilities of your being are greater than you could ever know.
      
        So if you try, really and truly try to change, then you can, because there are no limits to faith.
      
        For it is only once you allow yourself to change perspective that you can change form.
      
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And like all things in the universe, the human is made of physical parts, blood and bones, memories and fears.
      
        For the human is not just one thing, it is many things, because its parts are alive, fighting for themselves against death.
      
        And through shared stories and jokes, charisma and aura and touch, the human can spread its life, influencing not just itself, but the world around it, too.
      
        So the human is part of its world, a small piece of the families and communities formed through the collective effort and struggle and cooperation of humanity.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But in a way, this is the beauty of the human, because even though you are part of a billion things and made of a trillion more, it does not matter, because you are you.
      
        And you feel it in your heart and soul, truly and undeniably, that you are one thing, that you are human.
      
        And it is easy sometimes to view your body as separate from your brain, almost as if your brain controls your body.
      
        But this is only an illusion, for the human brain is remarkable, indeed, its language and knowledge fighting to convince you that they are strong.
      
        But it is not just your brain that is remarkable, for the human is the result of eons of life coming together to fight death since the beginning of it all.
      
        So the human is more than just intelligent, the human is adaptable, able to overcome almost any challenge it faces, and perhaps most importantly, the human can hold faith.
      
        And it may be impossible to truly know where your life begins and ends, but in faith, you know that your spirit or your family or your religion is the greatest expression of life.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And if you find yourself sick or injured or sad, it is easy to think that your body or blood or immune system will heal you, or that your world or society must change.
      
        And these things are alive, and they are impressive, indeed, but they can only ever be a part of you, so you must heal yourself.
      
        For the human has so many dimensions, your hidden past and your hopeful future, the ability to change and the ability to relax, the complexity of your flesh and the passion of your connection.
      
        So it is easy sometimes to fall out of balance, to feed one part of you, and neglect another, as the days roll by.
      
        But even in all the pain and the noise, you are still human, so you must seek balance, aligning your faith with your humanity, fighting not only for your dreams or beliefs or belongings, but for yourself.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But there is good in life, and there is good in the human.
      
        Happiness, health, peace, it has many names, but it is not clear where this good comes from, or what it is, exactly.
      
        But it is there, and it is real, because the human can feel it, the wonders of joy and love and laughter.
      
        And through its wants and needs, the human pursues this good, seeking to achieve better states of being.
      
        But desire is a tricky thing, and it always will be, for the human can only ever have the moment, but today is never quite the same as tomorrow.
      
        And the desires of the human collide chaotically with each other, forming its next decision, but there can be confusion and stress, because these desires live inside the human, only ever fighting for themselves.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But the human knows that although it can only exist in the moment, tomorrow will come, so it tries to balance the good of today with the good of tomorrow.
      
        And as you learn and study and plan for the future you can grow stronger in the face of time.
      
        But even this can only be a pursuit of the moment, the closure found by knowing that tomorrow will be pleasant when it arrives.
      
        And as you live in your world, the things you do and think and consume, the people you surround yourself with and the hobbies you enjoy, all become a part of you.
      
        So even if it is not easy, you must be wise in what you pursue, because tomorrow is inevitable, no matter how much you wish to stay attached to the moment.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And the human is unbelievably complex, of course, so it is easy to feel that health and peace are complicated.
      
        But in some ways, the health of the soul is a single thing, and therefore it is quite simple, indeed.
      
        And it may never be attainable, in its purest form, for you are finite in this physical universe.
      
        But you are strong, too.
      
        Of course, you are a physical being, so there are limits in your world, but even if you have nothing, you can always have faith.
      
        So even though your state is not a choice, and your emotions and struggles are only part of this state, it does not matter.
      
        But there are no limits to faith, so through faith you can achieve all possible things.
      
        So happiness is a choice, in a way, because if you have anything in this universe, you have the strength to pursue it.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But there is pain and suffering and grief in life.
      
        And pain, in a way, is more fundamental than joy, because it is always easier for life to run than to relax.
      
        And the universe is brutal sometimes, for it pays no mind to what was or what will be, it simply is.
      
        For no matter how strong you are in life and in faith, the human is a physical being, a fragile collection of flesh and bones.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        So it is only natural that humans seek to avoid pain, in search of comfort and safety.
      
        To be comfortable is to be certain, to know that when the next moment arrives, it will be okay.
      
        Sleep, for example, is the ultimate surrender of faith, the submission of yourself to the physical universe, the act of letting go of your ability to make any decisions at all.
      
        But in some ways, comfort is the opposite of decision, because to act or to move in the world requires uncertainty.
      
        And you must be careful, because as survival becomes easier, growth becomes harder, because it is only through difficult and uncomfortable exertion of will that change is possible at all.
      
        And there is terrible injury and trauma and loss in this world, deep and profound, but you must be careful, because if you do not face it, then it will become a part of you.
      
        But just being aware of it is not enough, so if you do not know what to do, do your best, for action is infinitely more powerful than thoughts or feelings ever could be.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And it is not that comfort is good, or bad, of course, because sleep and rest are necessary for growth and health and recovery.
      
        But to lie down in comfort is to die.
      
        Because comfort, like all things, will fade away in the face of time, so if you are not prepared for pain, then it will consume you, if not today, then tomorrow.
      
        But you are more capable than you could ever know.
      
        And to be alive is not a choice, and to be human is not a choice.
      
        And it is hard, so unbelievably agonizing sometimes, but you must fight, for you do not have a choice.
      
        Because if anything is sacred in this universe, it is life, so you must never waste it.
