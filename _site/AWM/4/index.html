      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/1/"><sup>1</sup></a></span>And like all things in the universe, the human is made of physical parts, blood and bones, memories and fears.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/2/"><sup>2</sup></a></span>For the human is not just one thing, it is many things, because its parts are alive, fighting for themselves against death.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/3/"><sup>3</sup></a></span>And through shared stories and jokes, charisma and aura and touch, the human can spread its life, influencing not just itself, but the world around it, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/4/"><sup>4</sup></a></span>So the human is part of its world, a small piece of the families and communities formed through the collective effort and struggle and cooperation of humanity.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/5/"><sup>5</sup></a></span>But in a way, this is the beauty of the human, because even though you are part of a billion things and made of a trillion more, it does not matter, because you are you.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/6/"><sup>6</sup></a></span>And you feel it in your heart and soul, truly and undeniably, that you are one thing, that you are human.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/7/"><sup>7</sup></a></span>And it is easy sometimes to view your body as separate from your brain, almost as if your brain controls your body.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/8/"><sup>8</sup></a></span>But this is only an illusion, for the human brain is remarkable, indeed, its language and knowledge fighting to convince you that they are strong.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/9/"><sup>9</sup></a></span>But it is not just your brain that is remarkable, for the human is the result of eons of life coming together to fight death since the beginning of it all.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/10/"><sup>10</sup></a></span>So the human is more than just intelligent, the human is adaptable, able to overcome almost any challenge it faces, and perhaps most importantly, the human can hold faith.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/11/"><sup>11</sup></a></span>And it may be impossible to truly know where your life begins and ends, but in faith, you know that your spirit or your family or your religion is the greatest expression of life.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/12/"><sup>12</sup></a></span>And if you find yourself sick or injured or sad, it is easy to think that your body or blood or immune system will heal you, or that your world or society must change.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/13/"><sup>13</sup></a></span>And these things are alive, and they are impressive, indeed, but they can only ever be a part of you, so you must heal yourself.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/14/"><sup>14</sup></a></span>For the human has so many dimensions, your hidden past and your hopeful future, the ability to change and the ability to relax, the complexity of your flesh and the passion of your connection.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/15/"><sup>15</sup></a></span>So it is easy sometimes to fall out of balance, to feed one part of you, and neglect another, as the days roll by.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/AWM/4/16/"><sup>16</sup></a></span>But even in all the pain and the noise, you are still human, so you must seek balance, aligning your faith with your humanity, fighting not only for your dreams or beliefs or belongings, but for yourself.
