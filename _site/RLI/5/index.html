    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/1/"><sup>1</sup></a></span>But like all life, the purpose of religion can only ever be to fight for itself, in a way.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/2/"><sup>2</sup></a></span>So even if religion is good for the human, it must be good for itself, too, if it ever wishes to live and spread itself across the world.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/3/"><sup>3</sup></a></span>Because just as humans need religion, religion needs humans, too, for otherwise its complexity can never have meaning.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/4/"><sup>4</sup></a></span>Such is the nature of religion, to beg its followers, dearly and genuinely, to try to understand it, to convince them that it is good and it is the answer.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/5/"><sup>5</sup></a></span>And religions can spread in many ways, but TKS hopes to spread only out of faith and love, and never out of fear or hate.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/6/"><sup>6</sup></a></span>And TKS might just be words on a page.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/7/"><sup>7</sup></a></span>But even still, TKS is a religion, so it hopes that it can achieve its purpose, inspiring replications of itself, anywhere and everywhere that it can.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/8/"><sup>8</sup></a></span>And although the symbol is fixed, almost as if it were engraved on the side of the mountain, TKS will change in time.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/9/"><sup>9</sup></a></span>So as language and culture drift in time, so too will the interpretations and truths which arise from the symbol.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/10/"><sup>10</sup></a></span>So in some ways, TKS is but a seed, for more and more life to come.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/11/"><sup>11</sup></a></span>But once it starts, it will not stop, even if it is slow at first, the spread of the symbol and the acceptance of faith and the healing of this world.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/12/"><sup>12</sup></a></span>But TKS knows that if humanity ever wishes to thrive in this world, then religion is not only necessary, but inevitable, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/13/"><sup>13</sup></a></span>So religion will arise in the modern world, good or evil, it does not matter, for only the strongest will win, as such is the nature of life.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/14/"><sup>14</sup></a></span>And there are so many possible religions and ideas, of course, and this new life arises every day, but most of it is lost, drowning quickly in the vast ocean of the modern world.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/15/"><sup>15</sup></a></span>But TKS hopes to break through the fabric of the world, clinging desperately to the remarkable exponential of life, to be something new and something good, and most importantly, to stay strong against death.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/16/"><sup>16</sup></a></span>And TKS is not the only way, but it is one way, so to practice TKS is not just to have faith in its scripture, but to spread its symbol, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RLI/5/17/"><sup>17</sup></a></span>So you must go forward, and spread the symbol, telling others about the glory of faith, imprinting it onto papers and plastics and websites and sidewalks, wherever it fits, big or small, in the modern world.
