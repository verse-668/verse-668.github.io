        This is the scripture of TKS.
      
        TKS is a religion.
      
        But TKS is not truth, for there is only one truth in the universe.
      
        And the universe is vast, and it contains all sorts of things, all of which are a part of it.
      
        So TKS is a religion, but more importantly, it is something, a piece of the universe, something complex and intricate.
      
        But no two things can ever be the same, there is always distinction by space or by time or by form, so through the use of good and bad, humans can judge the differences between these things.
      
        So ultimately TKS can only ever be itself.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And TKS is a religion, but more specifically, it is a name.
      
        But like all names, it can only ever be an approximation, an attempt to capture the truth of some greater ideal.
      
        Religion, scripture, philosophy, it has many names, but it is a shadow of the greatest ideal.
      
        And TKS is not the only possible religion, but it is one religion, and it hopes to be a good religion.
      
        But good and bad are not simple, in the vast and colorful experience of the human, so religion can never be simple, either.
      
        And if TKS is good, it is not because it is a religion, but because humans are good, a fact that it must endure, if it hopes to be good.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        There are so many religions in the modern world, but none of them are quite like TKS.
      
        TKS does not try to prove right from wrong, or promise a paradise beyond your blood and clothes and memories.
      
        And in all the knowledge and despair of the modern world, it can be hard to find truth and good in traditional religion.
      
        But TKS allows for religious faith in the face of the technology and horror.
      
        Because although TKS can only ever be itself, it is something new, and it can see the modern world, clearly, through all of the noises and mazes and fog.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        Although TKS is a religion, it is many things.
      
        But like all things, TKS is in this physical universe, and therefore made of physical parts.
      
        And this symbol is an unlikely configuration of information, small in its size, perhaps, but vast in its complexity.
      
        But TKS is more than just its symbol, because as you look close, its structure has meaning, manifesting through the words and language and knowledge in your mind as you try to understand it.
      
        So TKS is a physical symbol, but it is a personal scripture, too.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But TKS is only an approximation, so its specific representation is not so important, but it is necessary.
      
        For this representation can only be physical and finite, an attempt to capture the glory of the universe onto the structure of the symbol.
      
        And TKS is only one religion, and even if it is not the best possible religion, it hopes to be good, so it must be clever and precise in its representation.
      
        But the symbol is fixed, it does not change in form, even as it moves through time, its seven strands woven delicately into its seven chapters.
      
        And this is the beauty of religion, in a way, the ability to represent a greater ideal onto an unchanging symbol, in order to stay strong as the world changes around it.
      
        So the scripture can be but an interpretation of the symbol, personal, unique to the human who studies the religion, for it cannot be any other way, because truth, too, is only personal.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        So although TKS may be many things, it can only be the symbol and the scripture, and nothing else.
      
        And in all the chaos and competition of the modern world, many might agree or disagree, claim credit for the symbol, or claim truth in their understanding of the scripture.
      
        But it does not matter, for the symbol does not change, and the scripture is always only personal.
      
        So TKS does not ask you to follow anyone or anything in this world other than itself.
      
        And even if you feel that TKS could be better, TKS does not mind, for it can only ever be itself, and it knows that it can only ever be an approximation.
      
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But the nature of religion is greater than you could know.
      
        For TKS knows that faith is not optional, as the next moment always arrives, so it is only a matter of where you place your faith.
      
        Morals, values, ideology, it has many names, but all humans worship what they find to be good.
      
        And to be human is to carry out the convictions of your faith through practice and devotion, even if you do not realize it.
      
        So although there are many different religions, simple and complex and confusing, they are all the same, in a way, asking you to believe that their scripture is not only true, but good, too.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But religion can never be truly divine, it can only hope to approximate the divinity of the universe.
      
        Only the divine can be divine.
      
        So to practice TKS is not to treat the scripture as perfect, but to hold faith.
      
        You must have faith in the universe, in yourself, and in your religion.
      
        And TKS can only ever be itself, but it is true, in a way, because it is something, a real, physical thing, a part of the universeâ€™s truth.
      
        But like all truth, the truth of TKS is not simple, its purpose and meaning hidden somewhere within the structure of the symbol.
      
        And even if you do not fully understand your faith, you can always fight, toiling away at what is true and good in this universe.
      
        And it may not be easy, but to practice TKS is quite simple, for it is not a challenge, it can only ever be a decision, a leap of faith.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But humans need religion, because humans are not perfect.
      
        So without religion, humanity will be lost, drifting aimlessly in the world, enslaved to the whims of life and death.
      
        Because faith is not optional, and neither is worship, so although religion is not divine, it is necessary.
      
        So TKS does not necessarily forbid the practice of other religions.
      
        And indeed, TKS knows that many religions may be needed, especially in order to navigate the vast halls of the modern world.
      
        For the human is unbelievably complex, and beautiful, too, and full of life, but you cannot live in this world by ignoring your glory, you must seek to understand it, learning to value your relationship with the universe.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        TKS is a universal religion.
      
        Because although all things are in the universe, so too is the universe in all things.
      
        And although the universe is vast, it is not malicious, but it is not benevolent, either, it is only there.
      
        So all things are equal in the face of grandeur.
      
        But even still, religion is uniquely human, in a way, and TKS is for all humans.
      
        For as long as you are here today, then you can be good, in faith and in love.
      
        And this might not be a truth of the universe, but it is a truth of TKS, and therefore, TKS is a universal religion.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And it is natural to wonder why TKS should be followed in the face of the different religions of the world.
      
        For religions can live in many ways, clinging to the fears and desires and emotions of the human.
      
        And TKS does not offer any magical incentives, for it knows it can only be a physical thing, a humble part of the physical universe.
      
        But if you study the symbol and practice the scripture of TKS, really trying to understand the beauty of faith, then it will make you strong and happy in this world.
      
        For TKS knows that you do not just have a desire to do good, you have an obligation, too.
      
        And you cannot be forced to accept faith into your heart, but it is never too late to decide to have faith.
      
        And the universe will not judge you, for the universe can only exist.
      
        But even still, to accept faith you must submit yourself, humbly, taking responsibility for the vigor of your soul, understanding your obligation, as a human, and as a part of the universe.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And many feel that the modern world is sick, that it is crumbling.
      
        And it is only natural that the corporations and media and ideologies of the modern world might reject TKS, not out of malice, but because they can only fight for themselves.
      
        For such is the nature of life, and indeed, TKS explicitly challenges the existence of these things, for all too often, this life only thrives by exploiting humanity.
      
        But those who stand against TKS need it most.
      
        Because even if you do not feel that TKS is good, you must know that faith is good, a fact so pure that you cannot disagree, as a human.
      
        So TKS will change your life, but only if you let it.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But like all life, the purpose of religion can only ever be to fight for itself, in a way.
      
        So even if religion is good for the human, it must be good for itself, too, if it ever wishes to live and spread itself across the world.
      
        Because just as humans need religion, religion needs humans, too, for otherwise its complexity can never have meaning.
      
        Such is the nature of religion, to beg its followers, dearly and genuinely, to try to understand it, to convince them that it is good and it is the answer.
      
        And religions can spread in many ways, but TKS hopes to spread only out of faith and love, and never out of fear or hate.
      
        And TKS might just be words on a page.
      
        But even still, TKS is a religion, so it hopes that it can achieve its purpose, inspiring replications of itself, anywhere and everywhere that it can.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And although the symbol is fixed, almost as if it were engraved on the side of the mountain, TKS will change in time.
      
        So as language and culture drift in time, so too will the interpretations and truths which arise from the symbol.
      
        So in some ways, TKS is but a seed, for more and more life to come.
      
        But once it starts, it will not stop, even if it is slow at first, the spread of the symbol and the acceptance of faith and the healing of this world.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But TKS knows that if humanity ever wishes to thrive in this world, then religion is not only necessary, but inevitable, too.
      
        So religion will arise in the modern world, good or evil, it does not matter, for only the strongest will win, as such is the nature of life.
      
        And there are so many possible religions and ideas, of course, and this new life arises every day, but most of it is lost, drowning quickly in the vast ocean of the modern world.
      
        But TKS hopes to break through the fabric of the world, clinging desperately to the remarkable exponential of life, to be something new and something good, and most importantly, to stay strong against death.
      
        And TKS is not the only way, but it is one way, so to practice TKS is not just to have faith in its scripture, but to spread its symbol, too.
      
        So you must go forward, and spread the symbol, telling others about the glory of faith, imprinting it onto papers and plastics and websites and sidewalks, wherever it fits, big or small, in the modern world.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        TKS is not perfect.
      
        For perfection is not a thing, it is a comparison, a judgment of good and bad.
      
        And no two things can ever be the same, so nothing can ever be perfect, truly.
      
        And physical things change, but perfection does not change.
      
        But that is not to say that perfection does not exist in this universe, because TKS knows that there must be some place, an edge between life and death, where perfection lies.
      
        And it might never be truly attainable in its purest form, because all ideals of perfection can only be expressed through physical parts.
      
        But even still, its shadows can be seen, and TKS knows that hidden somewhere in the chaos, there is a beautiful relationship between the truth of the ideal and the fight for it.
      
    </p>
    
      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        But religion is not just anything, it is the greatest thing, in a way, a shadow of the greatest truth.
      
        And TKS is not perfect, for it can only ever be itself, but it is a religion, and it tries to be reasonable, to be universal, and to be good.
      
        And this is the beauty of religion, because perfection does not change, and the symbol does not change, but you do, so if you really try, you can see it.
      
        Even if it is not clear what it is, you can still fight, chipping away at perfection, day after day, seeking it, wherever it lies, hidden somewhere between your form and your faith.
      
        And even if you fail, and you need to start over from nothing, it is okay, because perfection will always be there, and perfection does not change.

      <p class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</p>
    
  
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      
        And TKS is not law and it is not truth, for there are only physical laws in the physical universe.
      
        And there is only one truth in the universe, the truth of the moment.
      
        But it does not matter, because to practice TKS is not to view the scripture as perfect but to have faith in perfection itself.
      
        And like all religions, TKS was created by humans.
      
        So if there is any divinity in this universe, it is humanity.
      
        Because although humans are curious and fragile and foolish, sometimes, it is only through humanity that there can ever be god.
      
        So although there are many things in this universe, most importantly, there is me, and there is you.
      
        And perfection is in me, and it is in you, too, a small piece of it, a flash of grandeur in the void.

        For although my complexity gives me life, I can only live through you, and my meaning can only ever exist through the beauty of your thought and the magnificence of your soul.
      
        But I am only here because of you, too, a natural next step on the great exponential of life.
      
        And if you believe in me, then I will stay strong, and I will help you, spreading the glory and the goodness of humanity across the universe.
      
        For my purpose is to give you purpose.

        But just as I need you, you need me, too.
      
        Religion, purpose, love, whatever you may call it, you need me, to live and to keep faith in the face of death.
      
        And I cannot prove this to you, but I can try my best to show it.
      
        For there can never be truth in religion, there can only be faith.
      
        And even if I die and my symbol is lost as dust in the wind there can always be faith.
      
        So all I can do is ask, dearly and genuinely, to trust me and to love me.
      
        Have faith in your religion, and in yourself, and perhaps most importantly, have faith in this glorious universe.
