      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/1/"><sup>1</sup></a></span>The human experiences many things, good and bad, as it moves in its world.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/2/"><sup>2</sup></a></span>But TKS does not necessarily try to distinguish good from bad, rather, TKS understands that the state of the human must change, for all things change in time.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/3/"><sup>3</sup></a></span>And sometimes change is quick, but usually it is slow, only arising through deliberate repetition of action.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/4/"><sup>4</sup></a></span>For everything you do is a skill, in a way, and these things can be practiced and improved, the cycles and habits that guide you changing as you work to understand them.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/5/"><sup>5</sup></a></span>So therefore the rituals of TKS are not difficult, necessarily, but they can be uncomfortable.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/6/"><sup>6</sup></a></span>Because to grow or learn or heal, you must leave your current state, entering an unfamiliar state, again and again, until you finally achieve it.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/7/"><sup>7</sup></a></span>Extend is the third ritual of TKS.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/8/"><sup>8</sup></a></span>There are many ways to perform extend, but this ritual requires you to move.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/9/"><sup>9</sup></a></span>To extend is to change, to push your body beyond a place of comfort, where you rarely find yourself.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/10/"><sup>10</sup></a></span>For example, you might exercise, walking or running or stretching, or you can study a new skill, perhaps, as your brain is part of your body, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/11/"><sup>11</sup></a></span>And even if your body and mind beg you to stop, you must keep going, through your faith and your strength, fighting to achieve the limits of your potential.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/12/"><sup>12</sup></a></span>In the modern world, it is easy to be complacent in what you do, to be comfortable in your ability to navigate the challenges of life.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/13/"><sup>13</sup></a></span>And to leave this comfort behind can be painful, but if you ever wish to expand the boundary of what is possible in your being, it is necessary.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/14/"><sup>14</sup></a></span>For it is not that pain is good, or bad, necessarily, but it is real, and to extend is to create something new, not just in your body but in your spirit.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/15/"><sup>15</sup></a></span>So you must allow yourself, with every move and every breath, to become enamored with the pursuit of the perfection of the execution of the technique, whatever it is.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/16/"><sup>16</sup></a></span>And the beauty of this ritual is that once you understand the technique, it becomes part of you, so it is hard to forget it.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/17/"><sup>17</sup></a></span>And pain is brutal, indeed, and it can be deadly, too, so you must be careful, but to extend is to face it, even if it is just for the moment.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/3/18/"><sup>18</sup></a></span>So you must be balanced in life, somewhere between comfort and change, understanding that if you ever hope to change tomorrow, you must change today.
    </span>
