      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/1/"><sup>1</sup></a></span>When the human acts, the consequences of these actions ripple through the universe.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/2/"><sup>2</sup></a></span>And TKS understands that this is the reality of the human, in a way, as you impose your structure onto the world around you, creating meaning and order in the chaos.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/3/"><sup>3</sup></a></span>But the self is greater than you can imagine, all the things that you know, all that you own, and seek, the results of your actions and the memories you hold close, coming together to create you.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/4/"><sup>4</sup></a></span>So the rituals of TKS are personal, but they are more than that, because TKS knows that the human lives not just in its body, but in its world, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/5/"><sup>5</sup></a></span>So if you hope to change the world, you can, but only if you change yourself, because even the world can only ever be part of you, a piece of your personal truth.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/6/"><sup>6</sup></a></span>Tidy is the fifth ritual of TKS.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/7/"><sup>7</sup></a></span>There are many ways to perform tidy, but this ritual requires you to organize the self.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/8/"><sup>8</sup></a></span>To tidy is to change, not that which is part of your body or mind, but something that is outside of your skin, and reshape it into a calmer and more structured state.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/9/"><sup>9</sup></a></span>For example, you might clean your room, or organize some old photos, do your laundry, or even take care of your hair or nails.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/10/"><sup>10</sup></a></span>Because that which lies outside of you cannot feel pain, no matter how important or meaningful it is, so it can be easy to neglect these parts of you.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/11/"><sup>11</sup></a></span>So you should try to understand why you appreciate this extension of yourself, considering the good and the bad, being critical of it, but being proud of it, too.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/12/"><sup>12</sup></a></span>But sometimes, the self can be so expansive that it is overwhelming, especially in the modern world.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/13/"><sup>13</sup></a></span>It is easy to get caught up in the ripples of the self, the things people think, the social media and the social pressures, the money and the power and the fame.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/14/"><sup>14</sup></a></span>And it is not that these things are good, or bad, but they are not human, and they are far away.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/15/"><sup>15</sup></a></span>So you must be careful, for the illusion of the importance of these things is powerful, because it must be, as these things can only live by convincing the human to pursue them.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/16/"><sup>16</sup></a></span>But to tidy is to look close by, at that which you can truly see and feel in your world, and to not just appreciate it, but to fight for it, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/17/"><sup>17</sup></a></span>Because even the parts of yourself that are outside of you are subject to the descent of time, drifting into more likely and less structured states, like pouring gold into sand.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/18/"><sup>18</sup></a></span>But no matter how hard you try, shaking and stirring violently will never be able to separate the gold from the sand.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/19/"><sup>19</sup></a></span>For it is only through deliberate organization that the greatest reaches of your spirit can be achieved.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/5/20/"><sup>20</sup></a></span>So you must hold that which you love close, because the self that you create in this world will bump and crash into itself, flowing right back into you.
    </span>
