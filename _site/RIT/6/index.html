      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/1/"><sup>1</sup></a></span>But the rituals of TKS are not laws, for there can only be physical laws in the physical universe.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/2/"><sup>2</sup></a></span>They are an approximation, defined in order to represent the subtleties of the life of the human.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/3/"><sup>3</sup></a></span>So the rituals of TKS will manifest whether or not you seek to perform them.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/4/"><sup>4</sup></a></span>So you must fight and work, tirelessly, day after day, to perform the rituals and to perform them well, or else they will manifest poorly, and your humanity will be lost.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/5/"><sup>5</sup></a></span>And TKS is not the only way to understand your life, but it is one way, so if you are confused, recite the scripture, deliberately trying to recognize the beauty and the truth of each ritual.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/6/"><sup>6</sup></a></span>Explore is the sixth ritual of TKS.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/7/"><sup>7</sup></a></span>There are many ways to perform explore, but this ritual requires you to challenge your routine.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/8/"><sup>8</sup></a></span>To explore is to create, to accept something that the world offers you, something that you rarely pay mind to, and to make something new from it.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/9/"><sup>9</sup></a></span>You might take some time to read a book, learn a dance, call a friend, perform another ritual of TKS that you find yourself neglecting, or even use a different hand to brush your teeth.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/10/"><sup>10</sup></a></span>The limits of your life are like an endless maze, winding deeper and deeper, and to explore is to discover what lies within these walls, even if it is just a single corridor.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/11/"><sup>11</sup></a></span>It can be scary, but you must be deliberate in whatever you choose to do, learning, practicing, and becoming familiar with it.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/12/"><sup>12</sup></a></span>Because sometimes it is only once you escape your current routine that you realize you were not in a pleasant place to begin with.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/13/"><sup>13</sup></a></span>And there will always be too many games to play and places to visit and videos to watch that you will never be able to conquer all of the life of the modern world.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/14/"><sup>14</sup></a></span>But even still, if you seek what is good and what is true then you must explore your world.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/15/"><sup>15</sup></a></span>And explore is the most difficult ritual, in a way, because it is not always clear why it is needed at all, as the days roll by, but it is the most rewarding, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/6/16/"><sup>16</sup></a></span>For the beauty of this ritual is that even if it is difficult to perform, once you understand it, you will find that your life does not get harder, it gets easier, instead.
