      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/1/"><sup>1</sup></a></span>Although the human is a remarkable system, it is a physical being, at the mercy of the descent of time.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/2/"><sup>2</sup></a></span>There are many things that the human needs to maintain its state across time, air and water and sleep, for example.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/3/"><sup>3</sup></a></span>But these things are not unique to the human, because all life can only exist by consuming the energy of the universe, an exchange of sorts.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/4/"><sup>4</sup></a></span>And it is not an exchange of energy, exactly, but one of entropy, as life plays the game of death, scattering the heat of the universe, and in return, life can keep its unlikely state.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/5/"><sup>5</sup></a></span>So the human fights against death, accepting the energy that it finds and using it to stay alive, day after day.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/6/"><sup>6</sup></a></span>But life is not perfect, so its state is never quite the same, the human and all of its parts growing older in each moment.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/7/"><sup>7</sup></a></span>And whatever you consume becomes part of you, for the human is a physical being, its complexity only possible through its relationship with the universe.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/8/"><sup>8</sup></a></span>But TKS knows that no matter what you consume, you must consume it intentionally, savoring this exchange of life.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/9/"><sup>9</sup></a></span>Glow is the fourth ritual of TKS.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/10/"><sup>10</sup></a></span>There are many ways to perform glow, but this ritual requires you to appreciate the purest forms of energy in your world.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/11/"><sup>11</sup></a></span>To glow is to be hungry, but to be satisfied, to not just be alive, but to be happy and to be free in the moment, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/12/"><sup>12</sup></a></span>Most easily, you might go outside, and allow the sunlight to hit your face, appreciating the clean and crisp air, perhaps letting yourself smile, if you can.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/13/"><sup>13</sup></a></span>But there are many ways to perform glow, indeed, because there is so much that you need in this world, as a human, simple things, pure and pleasant.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/14/"><sup>14</sup></a></span>The modern world offers many things, but many of these things are processed, and not genuine, and they may be delicious and enticing, but they can be dangerous and toxic.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/15/"><sup>15</sup></a></span>And it is not always clear what is good for you and what is bad for you, but to glow is to build a solid foundation for your life.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/16/"><sup>16</sup></a></span>And even if the day is cloudy or the air is rough it is still possible to perform this ritual, although you will have to be creative.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/17/"><sup>17</sup></a></span>Because the ritual of TKS is not about the specifics of good or bad, it is about allowing your spirit to be truly free.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/18/"><sup>18</sup></a></span>And glow is perhaps the easiest of the rituals, and it should be fun, but it is the most important ritual, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/RIT/4/19/"><sup>19</sup></a></span>Because to glow is not just to survive in your world, but to really live in your humanity.
