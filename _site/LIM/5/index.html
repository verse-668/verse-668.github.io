      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/5/3/"><sup>3</sup></a></span>For the laws of the universe are constant and cold, its energy gracefully following some optimal secret path, almost as if it were desperate to rest at the base of the mountain.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/5/4/"><sup>4</sup></a></span>And it may be impossible to ever truly know how or why this energy moves, but it does, manifesting as the lights and sounds and atoms and elements of the universe.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/5/6/"><sup>6</sup></a></span>But it is hard to say that a star or a planet is alive, exactly, because it is a natural formation, a likely arrangement of energy in space.

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/5/7/"><sup>7</sup></a></span>But there is something there, a gift from the universe, lucky to be together, so in some ways the stars are the purest forms of life.

      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/5/8/"><sup>8</sup></a></span>And life consumes this energy, not by destroying it, for that is impossible, but by allowing it to pass through, and eventually radiating it away as dust and heat.

      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/5/11/"><sup>11</sup></a></span>But the world keeps growing, becoming more complex and more alive each day, and some even worry about a singularity, a point at which this growth cannot be stopped.
