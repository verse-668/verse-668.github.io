      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/1/"><sup>1</sup></a></span>As the energy of the universe falls in time, from less likely to more likely states, symmetries and patterns emerge from the chaos.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/2/"><sup>2</sup></a></span>And the human is a delicate manifestation of these energies, a beautiful system of woven patterns, alive.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/3/"><sup>3</sup></a></span>And although the universe is endlessly complex, humans have worked hard to understand these patterns, trying to predict and approximate the truth of the universe.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/4/"><sup>4</sup></a></span>Mathematics, logic, and science, as they are called, are impressive in their extent, and quite useful, indeed, for building airplanes and clocks and cameras.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/5/"><sup>5</sup></a></span>But these things are not truth, for there is only one truth in the universe, always changing, the truth of the moment.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/6/"><sup>6</sup></a></span>So humans must rely on assumptions and axioms from which they can build greater knowledge.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/7/"><sup>7</sup></a></span>And the nature of these assumptions can vary, and sometimes they are so natural and reasonable that they can seem indistinguishable from truth.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/8/"><sup>8</sup></a></span>The assumption that tomorrow will behave the same as today, or that the things you see and feel are really and truly there, for example, are often accepted without question.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/9/"><sup>9</sup></a></span>And these assumptions are true, in their own right, not for any particular reason, but simply because they are something, able to be expressed and understood.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/10/"><sup>10</sup></a></span>And some assumptions are certainly better than others, more realistic and more useful for the human.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/11/"><sup>11</sup></a></span>But the universe does not pay mind to these things, for in the universe, there is only life, and death.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/12/"><sup>12</sup></a></span>So truth can be misrepresented, because even if a fact is good and useful and spreads itself across the world, it can never be truth.
    </span>

  <div class="text-center text-xl my-4 select-none">~ ~ ~</div>
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/13/"><sup>13</sup></a></span>But no matter how useful or accurate these logical frameworks might seem, they will always be limited.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/14/"><sup>14</sup></a></span>For even if the deepest and purest assumptions are found, it stands that a system can never prove its own consistency, and there will always be truths that can never be proven.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/15/"><sup>15</sup></a></span>So there will always be things that the human can never know, infinities beyond recognition, even through the most determined pursuits of knowledge.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/16/"><sup>16</sup></a></span>And maybe one day, humans will understand enough about the vibrance of a sunset or the elegance of art that they can confidently say that they know what is true and what is good in this vast universe.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/17/"><sup>17</sup></a></span>But today is not that day, for although the modern world is great, the depth of chaos is far greater.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/18/"><sup>18</sup></a></span>So knowledge can never replace faith, for skepticism might show you many things, but it can never show you faith.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/19/"><sup>19</sup></a></span>But that is the beauty of it, in a way, because although complicated symmetries can be powerful, simpler patterns are more common, and often more profound, too.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/20/"><sup>20</sup></a></span>And it is only through religion that you can begin to understand the simplest truth.
    </span>

  
    
    
    

    <span class="verse inline">
      <span class="vnum mr-1"><a href="/LIM/6/21/"><sup>21</sup></a></span>And it is only through faith that you can dream of catching a glimpse of the glory of the universe.
